                <div class="bottom">
                    <div class="auto-biography">
                         <P>     He is also known as Temitope Fash (Desaxparrot). He was born on the 17th of August 1989 in Ibadan Nigeria into a family of 6(six). He hails from Osun state, Nigeria.
                            He started his educational journey from Command Children School, Ann barracks Sabo Yaba, where he had his nursery and primary between 1996 - 1999, then proceeds to Mobolaji Bank Anthony between 2000 - 2003 
                            for Junior Secondary school education and Lagos City senior College, Lagos between 2003 - 2008. He gained admission into Federal college of Education (technical) Akoka Yaba Lagos to study Business Education (Secretarial) between 2008 - 2010. 
                            He was born into a music family. His father (Olubayo Fasesin) is also a composer, a singer, and still plays the piano. Being part of a choir group as a singer in a religious local assembly where he led, Fash discovered his drive for music generally. 
                            Then he started exploring his interest in the woodwind instruments, starting with the recorder, then along the line, picked up a relic of an alto saxophone at the console room in his dad's choir space. With a bad neck and no mouthpiece, and reeds,
                             he began to hustle his way to fix the sax and started learning on his own till he got a coach who couldn't take him for long because he couldn't afford to hire him properly but after few years of self teaching and research, he got a 
                             scholarship from his God mother (Dr Doyin Sagoe) who is an elder in The Capstone Resource Centre, where he was recruited as a full time saxophonist to study Jazz and contemporary music at SPAN Academy of jazz and 
                             contemporary music in order to get certified in Saxophone and music performance in 2021. 
                            In the early years of his career development, His passion for the Arts drove him to acquire an informal training in order to become a theatre practitioner with Crown Troupe of Africa led by Segun Adefila in Bariga Lagos Nigeria. However, 
                            He was inducted formally into the theatre arts fold through the Lagos State University LASU in 2012 with a certification of induction. 
                            He has lived all his life as a theatre enthusiast and a total & passionate performance artist. His multi-disciplinary practice cuts across music, theatre and other community art-based practices. His work focuses on the potential of sound to heal,
                             and create equilibrium spectrums in the mind and the environment.⁠
                            His first debut was released 2019 shortly before he gained an admission into Jazz school. With an informal knowledge and creative prowess, he released a tune titled Ęseun (Thank you) a smooth jazz instrumental music.
                            And after he graduated from Span Academy of jazz and contemporary music, His spectrum as a folkjazz instrumental musician is adeptly curated in his 2nd instrumental single titled Èmò (Strange thing).

                        <P>
                            Artitude with Fash is an artistic trademark for the brand Temitope Fash (Desaxparrot). I
                            t was inspired from the quest and quench for personal growth then transcends to a burden to change a narrative about
                             'reinventing the wheels' which has purged a huge pressure to perform or outperform as an artist hence has held a lot of
                              creatives bound both in the 'spiritual'
                             world and the circular world that they tend to loose their core purpose in being original.
